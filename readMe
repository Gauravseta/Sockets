********************* Upstox basic socket App ********************


========Steps To run locally===========

1.run "npm install"
2.run "node server.js"
3. Also environment variable "PORT" can be set, to run at different port than default port.


==================Known issues =======================

1. Unable to connect to Websocket API, hence socket communication is made with local node server itself, and a counter has been implemented to prove the socket communication implementation.
2. App has been developed to be viewed on latest chrome.
